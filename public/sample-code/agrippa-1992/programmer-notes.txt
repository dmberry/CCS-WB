LETTER FROM PROGRAMMER (March 28, 1992)
Item #D6 - Regarding the encryption algorithm

The programmer describes the encryption design in a letter to the publisher:

"I've been thinking about the 'DES' algorithm [Data Encryption Standard] and how
to implement it for Agrippa. The scrolling text will need to be timed carefully
so that the entire poem plays out over approximately 8-10 minutes.

The encryption routine will trigger automatically after the final line scrolls
off screen. The key is derived from the system time, making each encryption
unique and unreproducible.

The program is written in Macintosh Allegro Common Lisp and will be compiled
into a standalone application. The text file itself is embedded in the resource
fork of the Mac application."

NOTES ON AGRIPPA'S CODE (March 25, 1992)
Item #D7 - Technical specifications

From the programmer's working notes:

"Scrolling routine:
- Text displays in fixed-width font
- Scroll rate: approximately 3-4 lines per second
- No user controls (no pause, rewind, or stop)
- Visual effect: continuous upward scroll, like film credits

Encryption method:
- After final line disappears, wait 2-3 seconds
- Apply XOR cipher to text file using time-based seed
- Overwrite original text in memory and on disk
- Display 'encryption complete' visual effect

Implementation notes:
- Mac System 7 compatibility required
- Total binary size: under 500KB
- Lisp compiled to 68k machine code
- Resource fork contains: text, fonts, graphics resources"

LETTER FROM PROGRAMMER (May 7, 1992)
Item #D32 - Regarding distribution and testing

"We've completed testing on Mac Classic, SE/30, and LC systems. The program
runs successfully on all tested configurations.

One concern: if users simply copy the disk before running it, they'll preserve
the unencrypted text. But that would require some technical knowledge. Most
buyers will likely run it once as intended.

The encryption is more theatrical than cryptographically secure - it's meant
as a poetic gesture about ephemerality, not a serious attempt at data
protection. Anyone with a debugger could theoretically extract the text from
memory during execution, but I doubt that will happen."

[Narrator's note: It happened on opening night via video camera pointed at screen]

TECHNICAL DETAILS FROM "CRACKING THE AGRIPPA CODE" (2012)

From Quinn DuPont's cryptanalysis contest:

The encryption routine used a simple XOR cipher with a pseudorandom key generated
from the Macintosh system clock. The algorithm was:

1. Read current system time (ticks since system boot)
2. Use time value as PRNG seed
3. Generate pseudorandom byte stream equal to text length
4. XOR each text byte with corresponding random byte
5. Overwrite original text file with encrypted result

This made the encryption effectively one-way since the exact system time at
execution could never be reproduced. However, it was cryptographically weak -
had anyone captured the memory state, the text could have been trivially recovered.

The visual "encryption effect" displayed a series of random characters cascading
down the screen, simulating the appearance of the text being scrambled. This was
purely cosmetic - the actual encryption happened invisibly in the background.

From Robert Xiao's analysis (2012 contest winner):

"The compiled 68k machine code shows that Agrippa used Macintosh Toolbox calls
for display and disk I/O. The text scrolling was implemented using QuickDraw
scrolling regions.

The encryption routine was surprisingly simple - about 50 lines of disassembled
code. The theatrical presentation (scrolling, visual effects, timing) comprised
the majority of the program's complexity.

The program was not malicious - it did not attempt to damage the disk or system.
It simply encrypted one specific file (itself) after one execution. Very elegant
in its simplicity."

REFLECTIONS ON PRESERVATION

From The Agrippa Files commentary:

The programmer's prediction proved both right and wrong. The text was preserved -
but not through debuggers or memory dumps. Instead, someone at the December 9,
1992 public reading simply pointed a video camera at the screen and recorded the
poem as it scrolled by.

This "lo-fi hack" frustrated the work's designed obsolescence. Within days, a
transcription circulated online via FTP and Usenet. The elaborate encryption
routine was bypassed entirely through analog capture.

The irony: Gibson's poem about photographs fading and mechanical failure was
itself captured photographically (via video) and preserved mechanically (via
network infrastructure). The work's themes were enacted by its own circumvention.

In 2011, Freek Wiedijk extracted the text directly from disk using Mac emulation -
the encryption was never triggered because he dumped memory before execution
completed. The original "unread" copies remain encrypted, while preserved copies
proliferate infinitely online.

Which version is authentic? The one that disappeared as intended? Or the one that
survived despite intention?
