# Sourcing MODEM.ASM

The original MODEM.ASM file by Ward Christensen (August 1977) is archived in vintage computing collections but proving difficult to access via modern web protocols. The file exists in:

- Walnut Creek CD-ROM SIMTEL CP/M archives
- Various vintage computing preservation sites
- Gopher protocol archives (not reliably accessible via HTTP)

## Alternative Sources

For this CCS Workbench sample, we can use:

1. **Original MODEM.ASM** - If you have access to CP/M archives or vintage computing collections
2. **Later XMODEM implementations** - The protocol was rapidly adopted and reimplemented
3. **Protocol documentation** - Ward Christensen's own protocol specifications from 1982

## Accessing the Original

If you can access Gopher protocol archives:
```
gopher://gopher.floodgap.com/0/archive/walnut-creek-cd-simtel/CPM/MODEMS/MODEM2/MODM221A.ASM
```

Or search for:
- MODEM.ASM version 2.21
- Ward Christensen CP/M software archives
- S-100 computer software collections

The code will be updated once reliable access is established.
