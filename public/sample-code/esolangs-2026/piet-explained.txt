PIET PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE: VISUAL CODE AS ART

Piet programs cannot be represented as text files - they ARE image files (PNG, GIF).
Programs consist of colored pixels arranged in grids, resembling abstract art.

HOW PIET WORKS:

1. COLOR WHEEL SEMANTICS
   - 20 distinct colors arranged in a color wheel
   - 6 hues: red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, magenta
   - 3 lightness levels: light, normal, dark
   - Plus black (wall) and white (free pass)

2. PROGRAM EXECUTION
   - Starts at top-left corner, moving right
   - Direction pointer determines travel direction
   - Codel chooser determines which edge to exit from
   - Movement between color blocks determines operations

3. OPERATIONS BY COLOR CHANGE
   - Hue change: determines operation type
   - Lightness change: modifies the operation

   Examples:
   - 1 hue step, no lightness = push
   - 2 hue steps, no lightness = pop
   - 3 hue steps, 1 lighter = add
   - 1 hue step, 1 darker = duplicate

4. VISUAL AESTHETICS
   - Programs look like Mondrian paintings
   - Code and art become indistinguishable
   - Some hide programs in larger images
   - Others develop signature styles

EXAMPLE "HELLO WORLD" VISUAL DESCRIPTION:

A typical Piet "Hello World" is a grid approximately 40x25 codels.
It contains:
- Large colored blocks (10-20 codels) for pushing ASCII values
- Thin single-codel strips for operations
- Strategic black walls for direction changes
- White corridors for pointer navigation

The visual appearance: blocky colored rectangles in reds, yellows, blues,
arranged to look vaguely like abstract geometric art. To the untrained eye,
it could be confused with a small Mondrian composition or a pixelated
retro game sprite.

WHY PIET MATTERS FOR CRITICAL CODE STUDIES:

1. Makes syntax visual rather than textual
2. Foregrounds aesthetic choices in language design
3. Collapses distinction between code and art object
4. Demonstrates that "readable code" assumes text
5. Creates community around style and interpretation

- David Morgan-Mar's original gallery of example programs
- Each program is downloadable as PNG or GIF
- Includes "Hello World", pi calculator, and more complex programs

PIET INTERPRETERS:

- npiet: Official interpreter (C)
- pietinterpreter: Java-based interpreter
- Many online interpreters available
- Can trace execution path visually

CREATING PIET PROGRAMS:

Requires either:
- Image editor (manual pixel placement)
- Specialized Piet IDE (PietDev, PietCreator)
- Textual notation converted to image

The creative process is fundamentally different from text-based coding -
it's spatial, visual, and aesthetic from the start.
