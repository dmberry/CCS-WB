Malbolge "Hello World" Program
===============================================================================
Language: Malbolge
Created: 1998 by Ben Olmstead
Purpose: Maximum difficulty - exploring the limits of programmability

Malbolge was specifically designed to be as difficult to program in as
possible. Named after the eighth circle of Hell in Dante's Inferno, it took
two years after its creation for the first "Hello World" program to be
written - and it was generated by a beam search algorithm, not a human.

Key difficulty features:
- Instructions change after execution (self-modifying code)
- Memory addresses use base-3 (ternary) arithmetic
- All operations are cryptic and indirect
- No clear way to conceptualize program flow
- Programs are essentially write-only code

This "Hello World" was discovered by Andrew Cooke in 2000 using automated
search. The program is fundamentally incomprehensible to human readers -
it exists at the edge of what can be called "programming" at all.

Malbolge asks: Is code that cannot be humanly written or understood still
code? What are the limits of programmability? When does computational
difficulty become computational impossibility?
