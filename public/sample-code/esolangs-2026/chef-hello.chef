Chef Programming Language "Hello World" Program
===============================================================================
Language: Chef
Created: 2002 by David Morgan-Mar
Purpose: Code as cooking recipe - domestic labor meets computation

Chef programs are written as cooking recipes with ingredients, mixing bowls,
baking dishes, and preparation instructions. The language explores the
relationship between algorithmic procedures and domestic labor, between
the kitchen and the computer.

Key features:
- Ingredients are variables with initial values
- "Put/Fold X into mixing bowl" pushes to stack
- "Remove X from mixing bowl" pops from stack
- "Liquefy X" converts to ASCII character
- "Pour contents into baking dish" outputs
- Cooking times and temperatures are metadata

This program produces "Hello World!" following the metaphor of cooking.
Variables are ingredients (oil, zucchinis, etc.), operations are culinary
procedures, and output is serving the dish. The recipe is simultaneously
executable code and (absurd but valid) cooking instructions.

Chef asks: What is the relationship between algorithmic thinking and
domestic labor? How does gendering code as "cooking" change its meaning?
Can computation be nourishing, convivial, care-based?
