Shakespeare Programming Language "Hello World" Program
===============================================================================
Language: Shakespeare Programming Language (SPL)
Created: 2001 by Jon Åslund and Karl Hasselström
Purpose: Code as dramatic performance and literary text

Shakespeare treats programs as theatrical plays with characters, dialogue,
acts, and scenes. Variables are dramatic characters (Romeo, Juliet, Hamlet),
values are poetic descriptions ("brave noble hero" = 2^3 = 8), and operations
are stage directions and dialogue.

Key features:
- Characters are variables (from Shakespeare's plays)
- Positive adjectives increase value (good, fair, noble = +1 each)
- Negative adjectives decrease value (evil, foul = -1 each)
- Nouns represent 1 or -1
- "You are..." assigns values through dialogue
- "Speak your mind" outputs character as ASCII
- "Open your heart" outputs as number

This program demonstrates code as literary performance. Programming becomes
playwriting, variables become dramatis personae, and execution becomes
theatrical staging. The program is simultaneously valid Shakespeare code
and (absurdist) dramatic text.

Shakespeare asks: What if code were written for human pleasure rather than
machine efficiency? Can computation be beautiful, poetic, performative?

The Infamous Hello World Program.

Romeo, a young man with a remarkable patience.
Juliet, a likewise young woman of remarkable grace.
Ophelia, a remarkable woman much in dispute with Hamlet.
Hamlet, the flatterer of Andersen Insulting A/S.

                    Scene I: The insulting of Romeo.

[Enter Hamlet and Romeo]

Hamlet:
 You lying stupid fatherless big smelly half-witted coward!
 You are as stupid as the difference between a handsome rich brave
 hero and thyself! Speak your mind!

 You are as brave as the sum of your fat little stuffed misused dusty
 old rotten codpiece and a beautiful fair warm peaceful sunny summer's
 day. You are as healthy as the difference between the sum of the
 sweetest reddest rose and my father and yourself! Speak your mind!

 You are as cowardly as the sum of yourself and the difference
 between a big mighty proud kingdom and a horse. Speak your mind.

 Speak your mind!

[Exit Romeo]

                    Scene II: The praising of Juliet.

[Enter Juliet]

Hamlet:
 You are as sweet as the sum of the sum of Romeo and his horse and his
 black cat! Speak your mind!

[Exit Juliet]

                    Scene III: The praising of Ophelia.

[Enter Ophelia]

Hamlet:
 You are as lovely as the product of a large rural town and my amazing
 bottomless embroidered purse. Speak your mind!

 You are as loving as the product of the bluest clearest sweetest sky
 and the sum of a squirrel and a white horse. You are as beautiful as
 the difference between Juliet and thyself. Speak your mind!

[Exeunt Ophelia and Hamlet]

                    Scene I: Romeo and Juliet's conversation.

Romeo:
 Speak your mind. You are as worried as the sum of yourself and the
 difference between my small smooth hamster and my nose. Speak your
 mind!

Juliet:
 Speak YOUR mind!

[Exit Romeo]

                    Scene II: Juliet and Ophelia's conversation.

[Enter Ophelia]

Juliet:
 You are as good as the quotient between Romeo and the sum of a small
 furry animal and a leech. Speak your mind!

[Exeunt]
