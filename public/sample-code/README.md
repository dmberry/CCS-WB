This folder contains historical source code examples for use with the Critical Code Studies Workbench.

## ELIZA-1965b.mad

Joseph Weizenbaum's original ELIZA program (1966), written in MAD (Michigan Algorithm Decoder). This is one of the earliest and most influential programs in the history of artificial intelligence and natural language processing.

ELIZA simulated a Rogerian psychotherapist by pattern-matching user input and generating responses. The program demonstrated that relatively simple pattern-matching could create the illusion of understanding.

### Historical Context

- **Language**: MAD (Michigan Algorithm Decoder), developed at the University of Michigan in 1959
- **Platform**: IBM 7094 mainframe at MIT
- **Format**: 80-column punch cards with sequence numbers in columns 73-80
- **Notable Features**:
  - Uses SLIP (Symmetric List Processor) for list operations
  - Apostrophe constructs (T'O, W'R, E'L, etc.) for control flow
  - Dotted operators (.E., .G., .NE., etc.) for comparisons

### Source

This code is derived from historical archives and academic publications documenting Weizenbaum's original implementation.
