This document explains how to configure Supabase for the Critical Code Studies Workbench (CCS-WB) to enable collaborative features including shared projects, annotations, and the library system.

## Overview

CCS-WB can run in two modes:

1. **Local-only mode**: No Supabase required. All data stored in browser localStorage.
2. **Collaborative mode**: Requires Supabase. Enables cloud projects, shared annotations, library submissions, and team collaboration.

## Prerequisites

- A Supabase account (free tier is sufficient for most use cases)
- Access to the Supabase SQL Editor
- OAuth credentials if you want social login (Google, GitHub)

---

## Step 1: Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and sign in
2. Click "New Project"
3. Choose your organization
4. Enter a project name (e.g., "ccs-workbench")
5. Generate a secure database password (save this somewhere safe)
6. Select your preferred region
7. Click "Create new project" and wait for provisioning

---

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Once your project is created:

1. Go to **Settings > API** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Copy the following values:
   - **Project URL** (e.g., `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
   - **anon/public key** (the longer one under "Project API keys")

3. Create a `.env.local` file in your CCS-WB project root:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

---

## Step 3: Create Database Schema

Go to **SQL Editor** in your Supabase dashboard and run the following SQL to create all required tables:

### 3.1 Create Custom Types

```sql
-- Annotation types
CREATE TYPE annotation_type AS ENUM (
  'observation',
  'question',
  'metaphor',
  'pattern',
  'context',
  'critique'
);

-- Member roles for project collaboration
CREATE TYPE member_role AS ENUM (
  'owner',
  'editor',
  'viewer'
);

-- Accession status for library workflow
CREATE TYPE accession_status AS ENUM (
  'draft',
  'submitted',
  'reviewed',
  'approved'
);
```

### 3.2 Create Tables

```sql
-- ================================================
-- PROFILES TABLE
-- Extended user profile information
-- ================================================
CREATE TABLE profiles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  display_name TEXT,
  initials TEXT,
  affiliation TEXT,
  avatar_url TEXT,
  is_admin BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- ================================================
-- PROJECTS TABLE
-- Main project/session storage
-- ================================================
CREATE TABLE projects (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  owner_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  mode TEXT DEFAULT 'solo',
  session_data JSONB,
  is_public BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  accession_status accession_status DEFAULT 'draft',
  submitted_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  reviewed_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  approved_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  approved_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ,  -- For soft delete / trash functionality
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- ================================================
-- PROJECT_MEMBERS TABLE
-- Tracks who has access to each project
-- ================================================
CREATE TABLE project_members (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  project_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  role member_role DEFAULT 'viewer',
  joined_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(project_id, user_id)
);

-- ================================================
-- CODE_FILES TABLE
-- Stores code files within projects
-- ================================================
CREATE TABLE code_files (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  project_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  filename TEXT NOT NULL,
  language TEXT,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  original_content TEXT,
  uploaded_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- ================================================
-- ANNOTATIONS TABLE
-- Line-level annotations on code files
-- ================================================
CREATE TABLE annotations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  file_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES code_files(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  project_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  line_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
  end_line_number INTEGER,
  line_content TEXT,
  type annotation_type NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- ================================================
-- CHAT_MESSAGES TABLE
-- AI conversation history per project
-- ================================================
CREATE TABLE chat_messages (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  project_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  is_ai BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  is_marked BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- ================================================
-- PROJECT_INVITES TABLE
-- Shareable invite links for projects
-- ================================================
CREATE TABLE project_invites (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  project_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  token TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  role TEXT DEFAULT 'editor' CHECK (role IN ('editor', 'viewer')),
  created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL
);
```

### 3.3 Create Indexes

```sql
-- Performance indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_owner_id ON projects(owner_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_is_public ON projects(is_public);
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_accession_status ON projects(accession_status);
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_deleted_at ON projects(deleted_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_project_members_project_id ON project_members(project_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_project_members_user_id ON project_members(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_code_files_project_id ON code_files(project_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_annotations_file_id ON annotations(file_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_annotations_project_id ON annotations(project_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_chat_messages_project_id ON chat_messages(project_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_project_invites_token ON project_invites(token);
CREATE INDEX idx_project_invites_project_id ON project_invites(project_id);
```

### 3.4 Create Updated_at Trigger

```sql
-- Function to auto-update updated_at timestamp
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  NEW.updated_at = NOW();
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Apply trigger to relevant tables
CREATE TRIGGER update_projects_updated_at
  BEFORE UPDATE ON projects
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column();

CREATE TRIGGER update_code_files_updated_at
  BEFORE UPDATE ON code_files
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column();

CREATE TRIGGER update_annotations_updated_at
  BEFORE UPDATE ON annotations
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column();
```

---

## Step 4: Configure Row Level Security (RLS)

RLS policies control who can access what data. Run these in the SQL Editor:

### 4.1 Enable RLS on All Tables

```sql
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE projects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE project_members ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE code_files ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE annotations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE chat_messages ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE project_invites ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### 4.2 Profiles Policies

    )
  );
```

### 4.7 Chat Messages Policies

```sql
-- Users can view chat messages in accessible projects
CREATE POLICY "Users can view chat messages"
  ON chat_messages FOR SELECT
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM projects
      WHERE projects.id = chat_messages.project_id
      AND (

    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM projects
      WHERE projects.id = project_invites.project_id
      AND projects.owner_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Project owners can delete invites
CREATE POLICY "Owners can delete invites"
  ON project_invites FOR DELETE
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM projects
      WHERE projects.id = project_invites.project_id
      AND projects.owner_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Admins can manage all invites
CREATE POLICY "Admins can manage invites"
  ON project_invites FOR ALL
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM profiles
      WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid()
      AND profiles.is_admin = true
    )
  );
```

---

## Step 5: Create Profile Trigger

Automatically create a profile when a user signs up:

```sql
-- Function to create profile on signup
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, display_name, initials, avatar_url)
  VALUES (
    NEW.id,
    COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'name'),
    UPPER(LEFT(COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name', NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'name', 'U'), 2)),
    NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'avatar_url'
  );
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Trigger to call function on auth.users insert
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
  AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user();
```

---

## Step 6: Configure Authentication

### 6.1 Enable Auth Providers

Go to **Authentication > Providers** in your Supabase dashboard:

**Email (Magic Link)** - Enabled by default
- Works out of the box
- Consider configuring custom SMTP in **Authentication > Email Templates** for production

**Google OAuth** (Optional)
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing
3. Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**
4. Create **OAuth 2.0 Client ID** (Web application)
5. Add authorized redirect URI: `https://your-project.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
6. Copy Client ID and Client Secret to Supabase

**GitHub OAuth** (Optional)
1. Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
2. Create a new **OAuth App**
3. Set Authorization callback URL: `https://your-project.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
4. Copy Client ID and Client Secret to Supabase

### 6.2 Configure Site URL

In **Authentication > URL Configuration**:

- **Site URL**: Your production URL (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`)
- **Redirect URLs**: Add all valid callback URLs:
  - `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` (development)
  - `https://your-app.vercel.app/auth/callback` (production)

---

## Step 7: Set Up Admin User

To designate an admin user who can manage the library:

```sql
-- Replace with the actual user's UUID from auth.users
UPDATE profiles
SET is_admin = true
WHERE id = 'your-user-uuid-here';
```

You can find user UUIDs in **Authentication > Users** in the Supabase dashboard.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"new row violates row-level security policy"**
- Check that the RLS policies are correctly applied
- Ensure the user has the necessary permissions
- For admin operations, verify the user's `is_admin` flag is set

**Projects not appearing after creation**
- Verify the project's `owner_id` matches `auth.uid()`
- Check that `deleted_at` is NULL

**Invites not working**
- Ensure the invite hasn't expired (`expires_at`)
- Verify the token is unique

**Profile not created on signup**
- Check that the trigger was created correctly
- Verify the `handle_new_user` function exists

### Debugging Tips

1. Check the Supabase logs in **Database > Logs**
2. Test policies with the SQL Editor using `SET LOCAL ROLE authenticated;`
3. Use the Supabase client debug mode:
   ```javascript
   const supabase = createClient(url, key, {
     db: { schema: 'public' },
     auth: { debug: true }
   });
   ```

---

## Schema Updates

When the schema changes, you may need to update the types file:

```bash
npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID > src/lib/supabase/types.ts
```

Or manually update `src/lib/supabase/types.ts` to match your schema changes.
