# Critical Code Studies Skill

**Skill Purpose**: This skill provides a comprehensive methodological framework for Critical Code Studies (CCS), integrating two complementary approaches: David M. Berry's materialist-phenomenological method and Mark C. Marino's hermeneutic-rhetorical approach. It equips researchers to investigate computer code as simultaneously technical object and cultural text, functional mechanism and semiotic system.

**Two Foundational Approaches**:

1. **Berry's Materialist-Phenomenological CCS**: Code as crystallisation of social formations, examined through multi-dimensional analysis (literature, mechanism, spatial form, repository), tests of strength, political economy, and phenomenology of computation.

2. **Marino's Hermeneutic-Rhetorical CCS**: Code as social text with extrafunctional significance, analysed through critical hermeneutics, close reading, rhetorical analysis, and interpretation of meaning beyond functionality.

**Source Documents**:

- Berry, D. M. (2025b) 'Co-Writing with an LLM: Critical Code Studies and Building an Oxford TSA App'
- Berry, D. M. (2025c) 'AI Sprints: A Method for Critical Augmentation in Digital Research'
- Marino, M. C. (2020) *Critical Code Studies*

**Integration**: Both approaches share commitment to understanding code as embedded in power relations, requiring critical engagement with technical operations and social contexts. Berry emphasises genealogical investigation and political economy whilst Marino emphasises hermeneutic interpretation and semiotic analysis. Together they provide rigorous foundations for CCS as field.

## Core Methodological Principles

### Foundational Definitions

**Berry**: Code must be approached in its multiplicity as simultaneously:
- **Literature**: Readable text with hermeneutic dimensions
- **Mechanism**: Operative machinery with material effects
- **Spatial form**: Organised structure with architectural properties
- **Repository**: Crystallisation of social norms, values, processes

**Marino**: "Critical Code Studies applies critical hermeneutics to the interpretation of computer code, program architecture, and documentation within a sociohistorical context." 

**Key concepts**:
- **Extrafunctional significance** (Marino): Meaning grows out of functionality whilst exceeding it
- **Double mediation** (Berry): Software mediates relationship with code in both writing and execution
- **Code as social text** (Marino): Meaning develops as readers encounter code over time in shifting contexts

### Code's Dual Character

**Unambiguous dimension** (technical):
- Produces specific computational effects
- Must compile/execute correctly
- Operations are precise and deterministic
- Validated through tests of strength

**Ambiguous dimension** (social):
- Meaning proliferates through human interpretation
- Circulates within multiple discourse communities
- Subject to rhetorical triad of speaker, audience, message
- Develops connotations through reception and recirculation

**Methodological implication**: Cannot read code solely for functionality without considering what it means. Both dimensions require simultaneous attention.

## Analytical Frameworks

### Tests of Strength (Berry)

Code validated through dual requirements:

**Legitimate Tests**: Syntax conformity, programming conventions, compilation compatibility, specification fulfillment

**Material Tests**: Compilation without errors, execution of specified functions, correct hardware interfacing, expected outputs

**Critical insight**: Tests reveal code's limits—both technical constraints and ideological boundaries.

### Reading Strategies

**Close Reading** (Marino's emphasis):
- Examine naming conventions, variable choices, comments
- Analyse assumptions embedded in function names
- Trace gender, cultural, political biases
- Identify subject positions constructed in code
- Apply hermeneutics of suspicion—read between lines

**Distant Reading** (Berry's emphasis):
- Visual imagery and spatial organisation
- Architectural patterns and modular structure
- Code libraries and external linkages
- Dependencies and infrastructural relations

**Reading Levels** (integrated):
- **Surface**: What code appears to do
- **Functional**: What code actually executes
- **Social**: What assumptions code embeds
- **Political**: What power relations code encodes
- **Phenomenological**: How code structures experience

### Three-fold Analysis (Berry)

**Ontology**: What code IS
- Material composition, virtual existence
- Infrastructural embedding, mediated character

**Genealogy**: Where code comes FROM
- Historical development (media archaeology)
- Evolution of practices, programming paradigms
- Social formations of programming communities

**Mechanology**: What code DOES
- Dynamic operations, effects on social practices
- Structuring of everyday life
- Political and economic functions

## Key Methodological Concepts

### Extrafunctional Significance (Marino)

**Definition**: Meaning that grows out of code's functioning but is not limited to literal processes it enacts.

**Not**: Outside function, in addition to function, separate from function
**Instead**: Growing out of function whilst exceeding it

**Examples**:
- **Climategate**: Temporary "fudge factor" becomes "smoking gun" through public reception
- **Women on GitHub**: User ID number gains rhetorical significance through prominent display
- **Anagram job interview**: Code choices convey identity, style, competence beyond mere functionality

### Interpretation versus Isomorphism (Marino)

**Isomorphism** (computer science): One-to-one mapping between systems (like compiling)

**Interpretation** (humanities): Identifying connections, resonances, disconnections, slippages, forces shaping/distorting meaning

**Example**: PRINT command
- Isomorphism: Maps to display-to-screen or WriteLine in C#
- Interpretation: Evokes inscription systems, print history, remediation of paper text

### Code Metaphors and Tropes (Berry)

**Code as Engine**: Processing, mechanism, functionality (risk: obscures symbolic dimensions)
**Code as Image**: Screenic dimension, interface, aesthetic (risk: screen essentialism)
**Code as Language**: Expressiveness, communication, community formation

### Hermeneutics of Suspicion (Marino)

CCS operates under Ricoeur's hermeneutics of suspicion (deconstruction, poststructuralism):

- Read between lines
- Explore ambiguity and social contest
- Seek gaps and remainders
- Understand arbitrary nature of language opens communication to ideological influences

**Applied to code**: "Walls of computer do not remove code from world but encode the world and human biases"

**Means analysing**: Race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, socioeconomic status, political representation, ideology, power relations

## Practical Application Framework

### Stage 1: Identify Object of Analysis

- Select specific code, system, or software practice
- Define boundaries whilst remaining attentive to connections
- Situate technically, socially, historically

### Stage 2: Multi-level Reading

**Technical reading**: What does code do computationally?
**Social reading**: What practices does code embed/enable?
**Political reading**: What power relations does code encode?
**Phenomenological reading**: How does code structure experience?

### Stage 3: Genealogical Tracing

**Historical**: How did this code/practice develop?
**Social**: What communities produced it?
**Economic**: What political economy supports it?

### Stage 4: Critical Analysis

**Expose**: Hidden assumptions, embedded values
**Critique**: Political and ethical implications
**Evaluate**: Alternatives and resistances

### Stage 5: Synthesis

**Integrate**: Technical, social, political dimensions
**Theorise**: Broader implications
**Propose**: Critical interventions or alternatives

## LLM-Assisted Critical Code Studies

### Three Modes of Cognitive Augmentation (Berry)

**1. Cognitive Delegation** (danger mode):
- LLM responsiveness creates false confidence in unworkable approaches
- System generates elaborate solutions without signalling flaws
- Developer persists with misconceived strategy
- Augmentation becomes substitution

**Warning signs**: LLM never refuses prompts, generates plausible-looking code that fails, shifts judgement burden to human

**2. Productive Augmentation** (optimal mode):
- Human maintains strategic control over research/architectural decisions
- LLM augments implementation, rapidly generates code
- Clear division: human architectural thinking, machine code generation
- Augmentation remains supplementary not substitutive

**Optimal division**: Human (strategic decisions, problem design, critical evaluation) + LLM (code structure, implementation details, rapid iteration)

**3. Cognitive Overhead** (hidden cost mode):
- Managing LLM context consumes cognitive resources
- Constant version tracking, context management required
- LLM confusion requires repeated clarification
- Scaling limits: beyond certain complexity, overhead exceeds benefits

**Example**: Approximately 1000-line program reached cognitive overhead limits surprisingly quickly

### The Competence Effect (Berry)

Extension of Weizenbaum's ELIZA effect:

**ELIZA effect** (original): Users projecting understanding onto simple pattern-matching

**Competence effect** (contemporary): LLM's functional capability masks absence of semantic understanding

**Why more dangerous**: 
- Code works, bugs get fixed, system appears to learn
- Constant reinforcement that LLM "gets it"
- Evidence appears to support anthropomorphism
- Boundary between pattern-completion and understanding difficult to maintain

### Triadic Hermeneutics (Berry)

Traditional hermeneutics: Dialogue between interpreter and text

**Triadic structure with AI**: Three-way exchange between human intention, machine generation, executable code

**Hermeneutic spiral**: Each iteration produces not just refined understanding but new code becoming object of interpretation

**Implications**:
- Code simultaneously authored and discovered, intentional and emergent
- Whose intentions embedded in co-generated code?
- Need frameworks for hybrid authorship, distributed intentionality

## AI Sprints Methodology (Berry)

### From Data Sprints to AI Sprints

**Continuity**:
- Time-bounded intensive work
- Iterative refinement through feedback loops
- Production of intermediate mediating objects
- Commitment to open, teachable processes

**Rupture**:
- Distribution shifts from human teams to individual-LLM dialogue
- Potential "methods crisis" as LLMs perform tasks previously requiring bespoke tools
- Risk of losing productive friction from differently positioned knowers

### Six Key Principles

**1. Architectural Control**: Researcher maintains strategic authority over questions, frameworks, interpretive claims. LLM generates elements but does not determine direction.

**2. Intermediate Objects** (most important): Do NOT assume LLMs can jump to comprehensive outputs. Create visualisations, summary tables, coded excerpts, thematic mappings, extracted JSON files. Make LLM processing legible and contestable.

**3. Materialised Abstractions**: Intermediate objects emerge through grammatisation process that discretises and reorders materials. Remain critically aware of what processes of abstraction produced them, what becomes visible/invisible.

**4. Hermeneutic-Computational Loop**: Tight feedback between human interpretation and AI processing. Attend to intermediate objects, identify patterns/anomalies, revise prompts introducing different approaches.

**5. Methodological Transparency**: Document prompts, LLM interactions, decision points, failures. Enable reproducibility, critique, collective methodological learning.

**6. Reflexive Critique**: Guard against competence effect. Direct critical attention to seductive effect of speed/scale potentially coming at cost of nuance, rigour, context.

### Material Conditions and Political Economy

**Critical acknowledgement required**:
- Access barriers: Institutional subscriptions, API credits, terms of service
- Proprietary dependencies: Corporate platforms with priorities differing from scholarly values
- Computational costs unevenly distributed across institutions/regions
- Apparent democratisation conceals new infrastructural dependencies

**Reflexive methodology considers**: How platform dependencies shape what research becomes possible and for whom, how AI methods emerge from/reinforce formations of power and capital.

## Integration with Critical Theory

### Frankfurt School
- Adorno on reification and commodity fetishism applied to computational processes
- Benjamin on mechanical reproduction extended to digital
- Horkheimer on instrumental rationality in algorithmic governance
- Dialectic of enlightenment: Reason's emancipatory promises become new domination

### Marx
- Machinery analysis applied to computational infrastructure
- Commodity form and fetishism in code commodities
- Alienation in computational labour
- Industrial 'mysteries' parallel to code's technical obscurity

### Stiegler
- Grammatisation of knowledge through code
- Exosomatisation and technical evolution
- Proletarianisation of cognitive labour
- Automatic society and computational governance

### Foucault
- Power/knowledge configurations in code
- Disciplinary mechanisms in software systems
- Discourse analysis applied to programming communities

## Case Study Methods (Marino)

### Two-Part Structure

**Part 1: Technical Explanation**
- Present code excerpt
- Explain context and functioning in detail
- Define terms, explain programming structures
- Render code legible for uninitiated
- Annotate operations

**Part 2: Interpretive Analysis**
- Explore meaning beyond what code does
- Analyse extrafunctional significance
- Connect to social/political/cultural contexts
- Consider rhetoric, ideology, power relations

### Why Include Large Portions of Code

- Provide context for interpretation
- Enable alternative readings by others
- Show interrelationships within code
- Make transparent what is being analysed

## Multiple Audiences for Code (Marino)

Code exists for and circulates among:
1. The computer (executes operations)
2. The programmer (writes and modifies)
3. Other programmers (collaborate, maintain, extend)
4. Managers (oversee development)
5. Users (may access text in open source)
6. Judges and lawyers (use in legal proceedings)
7. Politicians and pundits (deploy in political debate)
8. Poets and artists (incorporate into creative work)
9. Humanities scholars (analyse culturally)

**Implication**: Each audience reads with different assumptions, priorities, literacies. Code's meaning shifts across these readerships.

## Warnings and Limitations

### Avoid Screen Essentialism
Do not reduce code analysis to interface or output. Must examine code's operational logic.

### Avoid Pure Formalism
Code not pure mathematics or logic. Always embedded in social, economic, political contexts.

### Avoid Technological Determinism
Code does not autonomously determine social outcomes. Analyse within broader configurations of power.

### Recognise Epistemic Limits
Code knowledge requires technical expertise. Cannot fully analyse without some programming literacy.

### Maintain Critical Distance
Neither technophilia nor technophobia. Critical engagement requires nuanced understanding.

### Guard Against Competence Effect
When using LLMs: Remember pattern-completion not comprehension, test outputs against behaviour, question plausible-sounding analyses, don't anthropomorphise capabilities.

## Research Directions

**Empirical investigation needed**:
- Thresholds where cognitive augmentation transitions from benefit to burden
- Comparative studies of LLM-assisted vs traditional code analysis
- Effectiveness of AI sprints across research domains
- Distribution of access and resulting inequalities

**Theoretical development required**:
- Formalising triadic hermeneutics for computational collaboration
- Extending critical theory frameworks to synthetic hermeneutics
- Political economy of cognitive augmentation
- Computational ontology and politics of abstraction

**Methodological innovation**:
- Best practices for LLM-assisted CCS
- Documentation standards for collaborative AI research
- Frameworks for reflexive augmented hermeneutics
- Protocols for managing cognitive overhead

## Conclusion: Code as Contemporary Challenge

Critical Code Studies positions code analysis as urgent intellectual and political task:

**Challenges**:
- **To humanities**: Develop digital intellect not just digital intelligence
- **To social sciences**: Understand computational infrastructures shaping society
- **To critical theory**: Extend critique to algorithmic governance and computational capitalism
- **To practice**: Develop resistant alternatives and critical interventions
- **For AI age**: Navigate cognitive augmentation whilst maintaining critical distance and political-economic awareness
- **For methods**: Respond to AI-driven methods crisis through critical augmentation not abandonment

**Core insight**: Code is neither purely technical nor purely social. It is material and symbolic, virtual and actual, constraining and enabling. Critical Code Studies provides method for rigorous analysis attending to this multiplicity whilst remaining grounded in concrete technical, social, and political realities.

In the age of generative AI, this multiplicity expands. Code becomes co-created artefact, hermeneutic object, and site of human-machine collaboration. Critical Code Studies must now address not only what code is, where it comes from, and what it does, but also how it emerges from synthetic processes that trouble traditional categories of authorship, understanding, and meaning.

The three modes of cognitive augmentation (delegation, productive augmentation, overhead) provide analytical tools for navigating this terrain. The concepts of competence effect, triadic hermeneutics, and synthetic hermeneutics offer theoretical frameworks for understanding what is fundamentally new about code in the age of AI. AI sprints extend this methodology into broader research practice, proposing critical augmentation as research ethos combining computational power with humanistic critique.

The challenge ahead lies in developing methods that leverage AI capabilities without succumbing to instrumental rationality, that extend analytical reach without losing interpretive depth, and that democratise computational access without abandoning collective interpretive work. Critical Code Studies, grounded in both Berry's materialist-phenomenological and Marino's hermeneutic-rhetorical approaches, offers pathway forward maintaining reflexive vigilance, methodological transparency, and unwavering commitment to humanistic values in computational age.
